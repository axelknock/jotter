            Jotter is a note editing web app designed to be self-hosted.

            Jotter is designed to be simple, so there is no interface to speak of.

            to create your first note, navigate to where jotter is being hosted. This will generate the first note and its identifying token. This token should only be shared with people you want to be able to access that note and/or create new notes.

            To create a new note, navigate to /new while logged into another note. This will create a new note, and its initial content will display the token that was used to create it.

            Jotter is not designed to be a comprehensive note taking solution. It is designed to do one thing well: an in browser note editing interface. No new features will be added that add to the interface as it currently exists.

            This documentation page represents what an instance of Jotter looks like, but not its functionality. None of the changes you make here will be persisted.
